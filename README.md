# yandere-launcher

An Unofficial Launcher for Yandere Simulator. Incomplete and will stay that way as an official launcher is on the way. I cannot ensure that this program can fetch the download link every time, as even a slight change in Yandere Dev's web page layout could screw the entire thing over. This requires either 7-zip or winrar to be downloaded and installed in the default locations.
